# Project Fletcher - Text Summarizer
Today the Internet continues to grow day by day and there are approximately more than 3 billion Internet users worldwide. The information overload has become a problem for a long time because of the growth of the internet. To help people to live their lives easier is my idea of building a text summarizer which is also the main objective of this project. In the meantime, the natural language processing (NLP) will be performed on the news articles to gain some insight of the dataset. This dataset contains 142,570 news articles published in 2016 and 2017 by different publishing companies and is accessible on Kaggle .
