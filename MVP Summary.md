### Domain

The two main objectives of this project is to build an article summarizer and apply sentiment analysis on the news articles. Text summarizer is commonly used in helping make dashboards for financial decision maker and sentiment analysis helps to scrape off the redundant features. By combining these two, hopefully I can build a model that can help deciders make better strategies.
